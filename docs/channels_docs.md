# Channels documentation
*Disclaimer: this is a guide on how to make your very own Homesynck client from scratch, not a guide on how to use official SDKs. Check respective repositories for such guides.*

Homesynck uses [Phoenix Channels](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html), a powerful abstraction over regular [web sockets](https://sookocheff.com/post/networking/how-do-websockets-work/).

Therefore in order to make a custom Homesynck client, you first need a [Phoenix channels client](phoenix_clients_list.md).
